      <p>It was the second time IRyS sang 悪魔の子, the ED of 進撃の巨人. It was totally different from the just-learned one, I almost can see Eren Yaeger in IRyS' voice. The difference showed me how serious IRyS thinks of her every singing and how hard IRyS keeps practicing and improving, even it's just an usual karaoke streaming. IRySoPro,definitely.</p>

I remembered in Youtube Chat that someone was saying "Baldrys" and I thought that I would also go with it and then suddenly many people in the chat have started spamming baldrys until irys actually noticed which made her laugh.

It showed me that they are so many different country's views and pets, and then let me know so many IRyS' reaction and opinion! Let me have a better understanding of my oshi! And I feel like make connection with different fans in the world. To me, it's really a unique experience! When I first time hear you singing, I can feel my heart seethed. And I fall into the voice and the reaction you have. I always think about that I'm too late to meet IRyS. So, to make it up! I'll as much as possible to give buck to my oshi! The luckiest thing in my life is meet IRyS. Thank you for company me when I feel alone. In the following days, I will support you till the end of my heart! Please take care of yourself!

      <p>My favourite scene is actually from the stream where you showed everybody the touch grass shirt that me and my dog Happy wore. However I'm choosing this particular scene from your Terraria stream because it is precious to me personally. I asked you in chat, "how was the gyoza?"; you answered "gyoza was great". That was it - that 1 second short, seemly insignificant reply - is what made me decide to be your loyal fan. It was the first time I received a response from you; even knowing that you didn't even look at who typed what in chat, I was still so happy. If you ever wonder whether or not you matter in this world, please do know that there's somebody in this world who treasures every word you say. Happy anniversary, IRyS! I wish you all the success and happiness.</p>

Cheering her on as she learned the game and got really good at it was some of the most fun I had just watching someone play a game, lol. She may not stream it now, but I always hope she's having fun with it on her own time. Cheers to you, IRyS, Legendary Tree Sentinel Arse Kicker! o7</p>

      <p>This is the one of my most Favorite scene to Irys it's almost hard to decide which one should I pick because many of her streams was memorable. Therefore I remember the first saw her was playing Debut Minecraft I was curious about her so I watch this stream. She was cute back then when learning new things in Minecraft and when she entered the wrong server I thought she was panic and scared but she was saved by her Senpai Polka for while . "She was my Batman!" The moment she said that was I started liking her many streams but even tho I'm busy irl thanks to the clippers I catch along her other streams. I have a dramatic reason so that's why I want to thanks IRyS so much to give me another chance to live and that's all want. 🙂</p>

      <p>I like everything about IRyS, she's just perfect for me. So, it is a bit tricky for me to choose one from so many highlights moment of her stream. But, if only I can pick one. I would say it's probably this one. Oh man, this one is just so freaking hilarious to me. IRyS dubbing Bae is soooo on point and accurate. I would never forget when that time I was a bit late(like several minute)to the stream and because I just waking up and don't pay enough attention to it. It actually takes me another several minute to realize that it's actually IRyS speaking behind the scene, not Bae. And the whole stream was IRys dubbing it all. I was so shock at that moment...and admired at the same time. And then, Calli called-in in the middle of the stream. She then shouted in disbelief: "Why are you sounds like each other ??" "God...How much do you guys hang out? Like I don't understand..." "Look, I know you guys are like...married and shit but like...WHAT THE FU**" Yeah Calli, now you share the same feeling as I do. And you just take the word right out of my mouth. This is exactly what I was thinking at the time. About how good IRyS really is at the dub and she really nailed it big time. IRyS is so talented, not just in singing but almost in every aspect. I also know that it isn't not just about she's gifted, but she worked really hard too. And that's what I like about her.</p>

IRyS is just like us who has also problems in life but she always do her best to give everyone joy and hope through singing and streaming and seeing her being emotional made me cry. Having the IRyStocrats showing love and support was very heartwarming, touching and wholesome to such why I really love this community.

These were in full display during her "Unarchived CARaoke", but somehow she managed to make its REBROADCAST an even better experience. It was truly crazy. Now, I'd like to share some quotes from the rebroadcast -- IRyS: "Oh, but make sure you keep your eyes on the road, yeah? Drive safe!" / GuyRyS: "Of course. I would never... look at you.

      <p>Your singing is amazing! The conversations between you and guyRyS made me laugh a lot especially when the slime knocked by the car. I love this stream so much!</p>

      <p>When I was making my coffee to prepare for the beautiful morning, I suddenly found out that you (IRyS) were having a guerrilla stream. When I clicked onto the stream what I saw was an adorable nephilim getting out of the bed slothfully, that moment I immediately knew this is going to be a hell of a stream! Just as expected, the stream itself was not only wonderful but full of "KUSA" vibes as well, as the screen was literally full of kusa. I must've helped a lot of old grannies to go across the street in my past life to ever witness such a wonderful streamer like you in my life.</p>

      <p>Hirys! It's Fridge. I really like your every stream, especially those you call it a "short stream" beforehand. But I think my favourite scene is not a specific expression or action of yours, it's the topic you are talking about. Apart from the usual anime topics, I think my favorite and the one that touches me the most is when you told us about your auditions in the recent stream. You said that Hololive is your dream, and shared with us some of your experiences, some of them were setbacks and failures, but in order to get the lemon that life gives you, you need to at least try. In the end, even if you failed, at least you tried. This really struck a chord with me because I've been going through a bit of a downturn in my academics lately. Even if I tried hard, I couldn't achieve the desired result. Although this may not be a big deal for other people, but your words have encouraged me in some way and it really helps me so much.</p>

      <p>Today is a beautiful day again, when I'm ready to go out ..... Wait a minuite... There's a futun on the grassland! It looks so comfy!! I should be ok to lie down a little, right? IRyS: ノಠ_ಠノ I'm very impressed with this stream, cus IRyS is not a Vsinger but also a Vperformer! I was glad to catch this stream before I went to work. Thank you, IRyS you really made my day! After this stream I learned that NEVER SLEEP OUTSIDE IN THE WILD and GRAB IRyS's FUTUN!!</p>

      <p>In fact, there are really too many things that I find interesting to talk about. But if I had to say my favorite thing, the narration performance at the Holo sports festival was definitely my favorite. I bet part of the atmosphere was definitely warmed up by your sense of humor.</p>

      <p>There are too many scenes that I love from IRyS's streams to pick a favorite to be honest hahaha. But this is definitely one of the memorable moments for me, it is when she sang Aikotoba III in her 100 days celebration. It was probably the first time I saw her cry if I'm not mistaken, and I remember how we kept sending hearts and showing our love to her. It was a very touching and wholesome moment, I think I also teared up a bit too haha. I really love and appreciate how she's always so sincere and honest about her feelings or thoughts to us, I'm not good with words to express this but it feels very special. I'm really glad that I've met you and have you as my oshi, IRyS. Thank you for all the memories! We love you!</p>
